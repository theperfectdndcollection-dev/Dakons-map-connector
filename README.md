# Dakons MapConnector

MapConnector is a free, lightweight tool to connect maps using interactive pins.  
It’s made for tabletop RPGs like D&D, with a focus on simplicity and visual clarity.

This is a small hobby project. I’m not a professional developer, but it works — and that’s what matters.

## Features
- Place pins on maps
- Move and organize pins
- Simple, tool-based controls
- Runs directly in the browser

## Usage
Open the HTML file in your browser and start placing pins on your map.

## Disclaimer
MapConnector is an independent project and is not affiliated with any other RPG software.
